I would like to clarify the discrepancy identified in the UAN check related to TeamLease Digital Private Limited.

TeamLease Digital was my first organization at the beginning of my career. I was associated with the company for a short duration of approximately three months. During this period, I faced health-related issues, due to which I had to discontinue my employment abruptly and was unable to complete the formal notice period.

As the exit process could not be completed, TeamLease Digital did not issue an experience letter or relieving letter. Due to the absence of official documentation and the short, initial nature of the engagement, I did not disclose this employment in the Pre-Offer Form (POF). This omission was unintentional, and there was no intention to conceal information.

Subsequently, I joined ETP International, where I worked for more than two years, with no overlap between the two employments.

For transparency, I am attaching the TeamLease Alumni Portal document showing my Date of Joining and Date of Exit, along with my bank statement reflecting salary credit, as supporting evidence.

I sincerely apologize for the oversight and assure you of my complete honesty and compliance. I kindly request you to consider this explanation and the supporting documents while reassessing my background verification.

Thank you for your understanding.
